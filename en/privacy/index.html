Any further storage will only take place if this is assigned to me by national or European regulations.

If your request does not fall into any of the above categories, my legitimate interest in the processing of your data is to answer your request properly and in your favour, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Deletion: The personal data collected by me will be deleted, if it is no longer necessary. I check the requirement every 2 years. You can also revoke the data processing at any time.</p><h2>Your rights under the GDPR</h2><p>According to the GDPR, you have the following rights, which you can assert with me at any time:</p><ul><li><strong>The right to obtain information</strong><span>: </span><span>According to Art. 15 GDPR, you can request confirmation of whether and which personal data I process from you.
